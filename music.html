					Getting a drink during the intermission of The Rite of Spring means you're heading for the bar somewhere between "The Adoration of the Earth" and "The Sacrifice". That ballet is about a virgin dancing to death before their elders. This album is about the same thing. It's about sipping on something cold halfway between adoring the earth and dying from it. It's about how loving inevitably means losing. And that dancing to death may not be such a bad way to go. Made in close collaboration with Easton Skara and the largest cast of musicians to feature on a Catbug record, Avouzon captures the time, place and community it was born in. It's an album full of the new breath of Spring. Tenuous and tender, it holds together like a bird's nest. Try throwing a rock at it and see what flies out.

				<td>
					"My plans are ill-defined" are the words of welcome on Not Going Well. Sono Pazzo invites us to share in this state of limbo. A synth pad rises and falls in endless flux in the background. A bassline creeps in unexpectedly, placing notes in odd corners of the arrangement. Each element embedded in a space that feels cavernous. Until suddenly the ceiling crashes in and we're buried beneath the chorus. Beneath distorted guitars that carry the weight of debris. And beneath a single, crushing statement that won't stop repeating. And we're forced to wonder if, in the end,Purgatory isn't closer to Hell than it is to Heaven.

				<td>In Sexy, Sono Pazzo slumps further down into the driver's seat than ever before. Singing with a slurred glissando, each phrase is delivered like a steady stream of air into a breathalyzer test. We're dancing along, but we're not entirely convinced the flashing lights we see are friendly. And this ode to the unsaid says we'll never know for sure. It leans into the interrogative light and says, "stop asking questions". We escape better in the dark.

				<td>Memory Card</td>
				<td>Catbug the Popstar</td>
				<td>Fall 2021</td>
				<td>A brick is thrown through a window in the 11&#232;me arrondissement of Paris. It's 2018 and Catbug sits above the shards of glass in a 7th floor walk-up. He is collecting little shards of his own. In the absence of other pastimes during his time in the city-that-wears-black, he produces a funerary collage from broken fragments and samples. The result is Memory Card. Four songs that sound like they're reverberating up towards us from the bottom of a well. Warped vocals tell a story we can't quite make out. Distorted organs, clipped percussion and references to Old Testament figures round out the Black Mass guestlist. In some traditions they burn their dead. No wonder Catbug set fire to that cathedral.

				</td>
				<td>SuperKee</td>
				<td>Catbug the Popstar</td>
				<td>Spring 2021</td>
				<td>It's a bird! It's a plane! It's the only pop-comedy album in the history of the world! SuperKee is named after the spoken-word virtuoso present on the album's interludes, Keenan Lloyd. His free-flowing, and fully improvised adventures of SuperKee are the big, beating cartoon heart-with-an-arrow-drawn-through-it at the album's core. He's accompanied by his brother Catbug, and a set of 7 songs that take a nod from superheroics in their arrangement. The colors are bright, the movements are bold, and each punch soars like a sound effect. This album could stop a bank robbery. It can get your cat out of a tree. The Lloyd brothers invite you to get carried away by this hero from their childhood. SuperKee has always existed, this is just the first you're hearing of him.

				<td>I Remember Back When the Mega Powers Were Bonded</td>
				<td>Dan Cubby</td>
				<td>Winter 2021</td>
				<td>This is where pocket-pop officially enters its Silver Age. Here the golden popcorn kernel songs of earlier Dan Cubby releases bloom into bigger bites. We've graduated from the sweet to the salty. Ragged rhythms and flavor-burst melodies get stuck in our teeth. There's substance to chew here but what we bite down on is lighter than air. I Rememberâ€¦ finds Dan Cubby expanding his frequency range wider than ever before. Higher highs and lower lows arc above us in a greyscale rainbow. Yes, we're growing up, but there's bound to be a cost. Maybe a melancholy we never knew before. Dan Cubby reminds us that if you grow too tall, you just might be able to spot where the rainbow ends.

				<td>Puking</td>
				<td>Sono Pazzo</td>
				<td>Summer 2019</td>
				<td>Puking is not a concept album. It has no outright narrative or explicitly stated theme. However, where some albums have stories, Puking has lore. The songs on Puking hint at some deeper shared knowledge between singer and subject. There's a sense of a time and place in the songs that, while specific and consistent, are not materially constrained. There are no referenced street names or titled landmarks, only "your favourite tree" and "the spot". And as the album charts this psychological landscape it becomes, not a concept album, but an abstract-concept album. We're invited into a universe of phantom limbs, where connections to friends, lovers and your hometown are never fully severed. Puking summons the dead without revealing the incantation. A spell once memorized, doesn't need to be spoken out loud.

				</td>
				<td>Sonic Yute</td>
				<td>Dan Cubby</td>
				<td>Fall 2019</td>
				<td>The three tracks on Sonic Yute act more as a single train of thought than a traditional tracklist. Like three movements of a single gesture, we're treated to the wind-up, the pitch and the hit (though not necessarily in that order). There's something galactic in the melting, glittering sonics of Sonic Yute. Like a soundtrack for when your 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale gets sucked into a black hole. You recline your seat and bite into the Milky Way. Outside the window you see endless threats and treasure. Outer Space is dark and purple as a bruise. Dan Cubby offers us a Danny Phantom band-aid.

				</td>
				<td>Imposter</td>
				<td>Dan Cubby</td>
				<td>Winter 2018</td>
				<td>A magic trick of an album, IMPOSTER manages to condense a full-length emotional arc into a 12min runtime. Like a ship in a bottle, we find a grand structure contained in miniature scale, but with minute details and dove-tails all still intact. And in this way IMPOSTER condenses Time itself. Sounds of ticking clocks float through the albumâ€™s opening and closing and remind us what universe weâ€™ve stumbled into. The pocket-pop universe, where Time is on trial. The white rabbit's pocket-watch tumbles ahead of us down the rabbit-hole. It only took 12 minutes to get here but it felt like a lifetime. Dan Cubby hit the big red button on the shrink ray and out came a giant.
