Scratched into his desk is a mantra: all science is observation. And on <i>Neutron</i>, we see how To-Do’s magnifying goggles zoom in further than others. The first line of <i>Valerie</i> slots in like a microscope slide —  “the three legged dog circles the cat” —  and asks us to imagine the geometry of an action. Pull the image in focus and let it spiral you down the song’s spine like a helicopter seed. “Isn't your you also a me?”, he asks. Isn’t all science philosophy? To-Do’s arrangements feel like they’ve been laid out with precision tweezers but he still accidentally knocked chemical X into the mix. Hear the overdriven guitar on <i>Neutron</i> enter with a splash and slowly spread through the song like a game of Snake. It’s music that sounds anchored in knowledge but anxious for the unknown. Some science is about discovery. And <i>Neutron</i> is a bright shot fired high into a dark sky.</div></td></tr>

<div class="album-desc">Getting a drink during the intermission of <i>The Rite of Spring</i> means you're heading for the bar somewhere between "The Adoration of the Earth" and "The Sacrifice". That ballet is about a virgin dancing to death before their elders. This album is about the same thing. It's about sipping on something cold halfway between adoring the earth and dying from it. It's about how loving inevitably means losing. And that dancing to death may not be such a bad way to go. Made in close collaboration with Easton Skara and the largest cast of musicians to feature on a Catbug record, <i>Avouzon</i> captures the time, place and community it was born in. It's an album full of the new breath of Spring. Tenuous and tender, it holds together like a bird's nest. Try throwing a rock at it and see what flies out.</div>

<div class="album-desc">"My plans are ill-defined" are the words of welcome on <i>Not Going Well</i>. Maple Treeway invites us to share in this state of limbo. A synth pad rises and falls in endless flux in the background. A bassline creeps in unexpectedly, placing notes in odd corners of the arrangement. Each element embedded in a space that feels cavernous. Until suddenly the ceiling crashes in and we're buried beneath the chorus. Beneath distorted guitars that carry the weight of debris. And beneath a single, crushing statement that won't stop repeating. And we're forced to wonder if, in the end,Purgatory isn't closer to Hell than it is to Heaven.</div>

<div class="album-desc">In <i>Sexy</i>, Maple Treeway slumps further down into the driver's seat than ever before. Singing with a slurred glissando, each phrase is delivered like a steady stream of air into a breathalyzer test. We're dancing along, but we're not entirely convinced the flashing lights we see are friendly. And this ode to the unsaid says we'll never know for sure. It leans into the interrogative light and says, "stop asking questions". We escape better in the dark.</div>

<div class="album-desc">A brick is thrown through a window in the 11ème arrondissement of Paris. It's 2018 and Catbug sits above the shards of glass in a 7th floor walk-up. He is collecting little shards of his own. In the absence of other pastimes during his time in the city-that-wears-black, he produces a funerary collage from broken fragments and samples. The result is <i>Memory Card</i>. Four songs that sound like they're reverberating up towards us from the bottom of a well. Warped vocals tell a story we can't quite make out. Distorted organs, clipped percussion and references to Old Testament figures round out the Black Mass guestlist. In some traditions they burn their dead. No wonder Catbug set fire to that cathedral.</div>

<div class="album-desc">It's a bird! It's a plane! It's the only pop-comedy album in the history of the world! <i>SuperKee</i> is named after the spoken-word virtuoso present on the album's interludes, Keenan Lloyd. His free-flowing, and fully improvised adventures of SuperKee are the big, beating cartoon heart-with-an-arrow-drawn-through-it at the album's core. He's accompanied by his brother Catbug, and a set of 7 songs that take a nod from superheroics in their arrangement. The colors are bright, the movements are bold, and each punch soars like a sound effect. This album could stop a bank robbery. It can get your cat out of a tree. The Lloyd brothers invite you to get carried away by this hero from their childhood. SuperKee has always existed, this is just the first you're hearing of him.</div>

<div class="album-desc">This is where pocket-pop officially enters its Silver Age. Here the golden popcorn kernel songs of earlier Dan Cubby releases bloom into bigger bites. We've graduated from the sweet to the salty. Ragged rhythms and flavor-burst melodies get stuck in our teeth. There's substance to chew here but what we bite down on is lighter than air. <i>I Remember...</i> finds Dan Cubby expanding his frequency range wider than ever before. Higher highs and lower lows arc above us in a greyscale rainbow. Yes, we're growing up, but there's bound to be a cost. Maybe a melancholy we never knew before. Dan Cubby reminds us that if you grow too tall, you just might be able to spot where the rainbow ends.</div>

<div class="album-desc">Where <i>Puking</i> is an album seen through night vision goggles, skeletal and stark, all black and x-ray green, <i>Dreamies</i> is infrared. There's a new heat here, running high as a fever. Vivid splashes of red, blue and yellow, like Superman got run over. The production is lush and ornate. The words shoot off each track like sparks. And Maple Treeway proves, once again, that his well of melodic invention runs deeper than magma. And there is a sense that something is boiling at the core of <i>Dreamies</i>. A deep, churning force in need of eruption. The songs, overwhelmed by this element, become casts of their respective longings, agonies, and moments in time. Each one human and heart-wrenching. A collection of Pompeii statues. But sometimes you have to be still in order to see the way forward. To look into those burning places without flinching. After all, "running free is a gesture". And <i>Dreamies</i> is all action.</div>

<div class="album-desc"><i>Puking</i> has a sense of sickness about it. The album's 12 tense, terse songs careen downwards in an ever-tightening spiral. Like a staircase to the underworld, or a stomach twisting in knots. Each song is a hit, a punch to the gut. And over the course of the album, Maple Treeway sketches the outline of a world. There's the feeling of a specific time and place that, while distinct and consistent, are not materially constrained. Like a map you scroll over still clouded in fog-of-war. The songs on <i>Puking</i> hint at some deeper shared knowledge between singer and subject. We're not in the realm of confession here, but of urban legend. Not of storytelling, but of lore. And Maple Treeway invites us into this universe of phantom limbs, where connections to friends, lovers, and your hometown are never fully severed. Where distant guitars and cavernous drums echo off each other like coins tossed into the crypt. <i>Puking</i> summons the dead without revealing the incantation. A spell, once memorized, doesn't need to be spoken out loud.</div>

<div class="album-desc">The three tracks on <i>Sonic Yute</i> act more as a single train of thought than a traditional tracklist. Like three movements of a single gesture, we're treated to the wind-up, the pitch and the hit (though not necessarily in that order). There's something galactic in the melting, glittering sonics of <i>Sonic Yute</i>. Like a soundtrack for when your 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale gets sucked into a black hole. You recline your seat and bite into the Milky Way. Outside the window you see endless threats and treasure. Outer Space is dark and purple as a bruise. Dan Cubby offers us a Danny Phantom band-aid.</div>

<div class="album-desc">A magic trick of an album, <i>IMPOSTER</i> manages to condense a full-length emotional arc into a 12min runtime. Like a ship in a bottle, we find a grand structure contained in miniature scale, but with minute details and dove-tails all still intact. And in this way <i>IMPOSTER</i> condenses Time itself. Sounds of ticking clocks float through the album's opening and closing and remind us what universe we've stumbled into. The pocket-pop universe, where Time is on trial. The white rabbit's pocket-watch tumbles ahead of us down the rabbit-hole. It only took 12 minutes to get here but it felt like a lifetime. Dan Cubby hit the big red button on the shrink ray and out came a giant.</div>
