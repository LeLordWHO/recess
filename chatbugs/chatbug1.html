    <a href="https://catbugbratclub.bandcamp.com/track/catbug-pop-quiz">Listen baby</a>, it's been a 
    long day and I'm tired. I'm thawing veggies on the stove so I'll call you
    when they're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJJKJoSlXO8">hot</a>. I'll mix you something 
    strong full of bourbon bubbled <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm">pop</a>. Don't talk. And
    then you'll see two of me. Just try and relax. The kids are next-door-tadpoles 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2u5Gbadn7o">dancing maypole</a>,
    burning match. They'll be <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static-smartexpat-com/legacy/classified_ads/charming-family-home-with-beautiful-jura-view-103295-photo-2.jpg">home</a>
    in no time, don't worry so much. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlMakizrpz4">You'll only feed the ulcer</a>.

    Listen baby, I'm tired so I'll try and make this quick: I left that lousy job. I fired, I got quit. And
    now we're free of money - just wait, now don't get mad. I gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEBQZ0ooLEE">cathedral beggars</a> all the coins my
    pocket had. Cause they're out there baby, watching cars they know by name. They know the truth
    about grocery stores and how much 10 cents can change. <a href="https://vimeo.com/50492133">They know that we're the vultures</a>.

    Listen baby, I'm a singer now so that means
    <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16769/16769-h/16769-h.htm#CHAPTER_II_The_Maniac">I watch my weight</a>. 
    I've got discs to press, an
    adderley cornet and dreams too big to swallow. I'm here for my 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGVacXTqF44">halo</a>. I was born to play. 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans#After_LaFaro's_death">I'm done</a> with being tomorrow.
    Baby let's get big. Compose a few more kids. When the album comes
    out you'll forgive me. <a href="https://youtu.be/lMMQz7i7sQA?t=4m49s">You'll love me when I'm culture</a>.
