    I'm writing a book.<br><br>
    
    I can prove it. I have a word document called "book". And another called "book
    ideas". These are all I need to get started.<br><br>
    
    I'm in a book club. We read modern fiction. Modern fiction has reminded me that
    anyone can write a book.<br><br>
    
    A good book should have three things. A beginning. A middle. And a twist. The twist
    is the most important part. Name one good book without a twist. You can't.<br><br>
    
    My book has a big twist. But so far the biggest twist is that I'm writing a book at all.<br><br>
    
    When I'm done writing my book I'll have it printed in the usual sizes. Large.
    Medium. And bathroom book.<br><br>
    
    A bathroom book is one you read while you're in there. Ideally a bathroom book
    should be light reading. The idea is that you shouldn't be in there too long. I have a
    different idea. My book will keep you on the edge of your seat. My book will keep
    you backed up.<br><br>
    
    My favourite size of book is medium. My favourite genre of book is war.<br><br>
    
    The first book I read I don't remember. The first book I tried to write was The Bible.
    I took out an empty notebook and began copying out page one of Genesis. I
    thought I'd like to have a copy in my own handwriting. A seven year old's
    handwriting. I didn't get very far as The Bible is a size large.<br><br>
    
    It was hard to write The Bible. I hope my next book will be easier.<br><br>
