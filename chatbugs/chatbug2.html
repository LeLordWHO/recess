        I woke up to a phone call from a number I didn't know.<br>
        I didn't answer, but they left a message.<br>
        It was a robot.<br>
        And the robot told me someone was filing a lawsuit against me, and that I'd better call the robot back or else a warrant would be issued for my arrest and I'd be taken away.<br>
        Arrested by robots.<br>

    There are other Catbugs out there.<br>
    One a Korean DJ, another a singer from Belgium.<br>
    My first thought was one of them had to be behind this.<br>
    There can only be one.<br>
    But it'll take more than robots to make this Catbug cry.<br>

        I quit my job.<br>
        I cut up my credit cards.<br>
        And I left samples of my hair and teeth in a burning car outside of town.<br>
        I'm off the grid and I'm making an album.<br>
        An album that even robots can dance to.<br>

        The danger disguised as art was still danger.<br>
        Made worse by being smart and God's anger<br>
        falls equally on the small as the stunning.<br>

        But keep it up.<br><br>
        There can only be one Catbug and I hope I'm yours.
