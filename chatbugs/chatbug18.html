    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>RULE #1: Take it easy.</b></div><br>
    The greatest idea has already been had. Someone already put sunglasses on a dog. The man
    who first did it lived as a God until the day he died, now he's gone and his children don't pay
    taxes. Their money's no good where they live, all their meals are comped and that's the way it
    should be. But this is not your fate. The best you can do is iterate and remix other people's good
    ideas. Put sunglasses on a basketball. Put a hat on a dog, stuff like that.<br><br>
    We live within increasingly shrinking concentric rings of cultural nostalgia. The best you can
    hope for as a creator is to take the pre-existing codes of past genres, artists, modes etc. and
    stamp some thin veneer of novelty on them. A little twist goes a long way. Be careful not to
    stray too far or you risk isolating the subculture your success depends upon. And don't forget,
    sometimes certain eras, styles or trends of the past will have a wave of resurgent popularity. In
    which case you can forego any twist or remixing altogether, directly parroting past art while
    riding that wave towards acclaim.<br><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>RULE #2: Be professional.</b></div><br>
    Remember that art is a service and when creating you're responsible to those you're providing
    that service to. The needs of the audience supersede the needs of the artist. So, as an artist you
    should always be asking yourself: do I think people will like what I'm making? Does this have an
    audience? Is this marketable?<br><br>
    It's important to avoid the selfish instincts of creativity, which often tip towards
    self-exploration, experimentation and indulgence. Instead, remember to selflessly seek to
    reflect the tastes and interests of an undefined mass of strangers. This doesn't mean your art
    shouldn't have a voice or a point of view, but you should always strive to project a voice people
    recognize or present a point of view you think others share. Casting a wide net is the best way
    to ensure you're delivering the work your audience deserves.<br><br>
    Similarly, stating that your art speaks for a cause, a politic, a community, a culture or even
    embodies something as lofty as "Truth", "Beauty" and other metaphysical concepts is a good
    way to keep your work grounded. Remember that it's selfish for your art to be only for, or about
    yourself. Instead, check your ego at the door and proclaim yourself and the things you create to
    be vessels and manifestations of transcendent values.<br><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>RULE #3: Be online.</b></div><br>
    These days it's popular to be critical of the internet. We all know the kind of negativity I'm
    talking about. People talk about doom scrolling, widespread apathy, degradation of attention
    spans, the shallowness of social media and so on. There's no shortage of haters out there. But
    whether the haters like it or not, the internet is at the centre of culture. Which means that the
    artists who best adapt, reflect and conform to the "shallow and degraded" values of the internet
    are the artists most likely to succeed.<br><br>
    This doesn't mean you necessarily need to adopt an "internet-y" aesthetic to be successful
    (although you probably should). You can hold whatever values around aesthetics, lifestyle etc.
    you want and still post about it. But definitely post about it. How else can you responsibly
    advocate for your values unless you're representing them in posts? How else can you advocate
    for your own art? There isn't a better way. And besides, there's no reason to believe doing so in
    any way affects or reflects upon the art you create or how it's consumed. Sure, we've all heard
    about an alleged connection between medium and message, but the guy who came up with that
    was Canadian. And he's dead. So what the hell does he know about anything.<br><br>
    When people look back at this time, they'll recognize that the most online artists were the most
    successful. And there's nothing wrong with that. After all, posting itself is kind of an art if you
    think about it.<br><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>RULE #4: Respect success.</b></div><br>
    It's important to always pay attention to whoever's already getting the most attention. This is
    not only how you stay in touch with the zeitgeist, it's also a surefire way to find the best art out
    there. Cream rises to the top as they say. So if you want good art, look no further than the
    things being placed directly in front of you by someone else.<br><br>
    Even if you dislike the most talked about culture of the moment, it's important to consume it so
    you can participate in "the conversation". "The conversation" is always thrilling, always
    important. And by participating, you'll get a better sense of how to turn your art into something
    people can casually discuss with their colleagues. You'll unlock essential tips and tricks that can
    guide you towards increasing popularity. Which is the same thing as success. This is an
    important point to emphasize: a popular work is by definition a successful work.<br><br>
    And this is the standard you should base all your artistic decisions on. Don't overthink it. Don't
    base decisions on the nature of the work itself. Instead, look outside of the work and outside of
    yourself for answers. It's all well and good to say trust your intuition, but unless your intuition
    has brought you a profitable artistic career, it's not all that worth listening to is it?<br><br>
