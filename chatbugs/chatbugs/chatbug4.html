    I sleep on the floor now. Wedged between the sofa and the stand the
    TV sits on. That's where I sleep. If you don't sleep on the floor you
    should try it. But be sure to be between two things taller than your
    own laid-out form. That's what makes it cozy. Like the walls of a crib.
    Or a valley with ridges on either side. Be the valley. Try sleeping on
    the floor. We all gotta be down sometime.

    I walked for five hours in the Louvre and felt exhausted, letting
    history get the better of me. I saw Napoleon's throne but they
    wouldn't let me sit on it. Not even after I explained to them that I was
    sick and very sleepy. The whole place is full of beautiful things you
    can't touch. A million shrunken emperors standing meekly behind
    glass. All exiled to islands locked inside display cases. And they pace
    around their shorelines and stare out across the sea that separates us
    from them and wave their arms to catch our attention so we'll lean in
    close to hear. But though we can see that their mouths moving it's
    impossible to make out the words. But I know what they're saying.
    They're saying, “Time is the arsenic in the wallpaper of the World”.
    And so I scratched at each painting until they called the gendarmes.

    I've been eating good food and horror movies every day. Getting
    plump for the slaughter. Or maybe just making Death feed me. Which
    might be making it Life. In any case it's Fall so we're all watching
    things die. And sometime soon, when my appetite stops yelling at me
    and I've drunk the amount of small french coffees it takes to equal
    one actual adult-sized cup, I'm gonna go to sleep for a long, long time.
    Because maybe there are seasons made for sleeping through. And
    maybe I'm just free to be nowhere. We all gotta be down sometime.<br>
