    A breakout of red spots all over my body from some unknown cause. I tell the doctor what I
think it is and he says I'm probably right. I pay him 25 euros, the entire visit having lasted
seven, ten minutes tops.<br><br>
The pharmacy clerk asks if I have insurance and I say “no”. The total cost, after the
government helps out, is 1,23€. She asks if I want a receipt to send to the insurance I
already told her I don't have. I say “yes” without thinking, and she hands it to me looking
pissed.<br><br>
My roommate sends me a message, telling me he took my duvet off my bed cause he had to
wash his own. He hopes I don't mind. When I get the duvet back it has a strange orange, red
stain spreading across one corner.<br><br>
My other roommate, with whom I share a wall, has the worst cough I've ever heard. At
night I can hear her retching and tearing herself in two. She tells me she's not sick, it's just
she can't stop coughing. When I wake up coughing myself she asks if I got it from her.<br><br>
I sleep in layers of clothing as my duvet is still drying. The heater on high, with the wet
laundry hanging, makes my room feel like a sewer. I picture a mushroom growing from my
throat.<br><br>
I awake sometime later sweating through my clothes. After checking the time I realize I've
only slept for about an hour. I dreamt about supermen who were evil and destructive. I
worry they'll kill me now for seeing how they look.<br><br>
A message from a stranger briefly lights my phone up. She's single and she says she's
looking for a man to milk dry. I see a message like this almost every day now, but the girl's
name keeps on changing.<br><br>
There's a lump in my throat and my body starts itching. I break out the cream the
pharmacist gave me and start rubbing it in. The more I apply the more spots I see. There's
an orange, red stain on me I just can't find the source of.<br><br>
I hear a cough through the wall and for some reason I feel guilty. It's my other roommate
now and I worry I passed it on. I know I didn't start it, but I know I didn't help.<br><br>
I hear it raining outside and think how my boot sole is ungluing. I had it repaired a few
months ago by someone bad at their job. A thin line of glue is still curling up the heel.<br><br>
I'm still disconcerted by my interaction with the pharmacist. I wish I could tell her I haven't
slept and that's why I'm dumb. But every explanation is an excuse of some order. I feel the
white stalk of the mushroom press against my teeth.<br><br>
When I want to sleep I can't, and I lie there for hours. I wonder about all the things I lose
during that time. I wonder about the kinds of things that only grow in the dark.<br><br>
I once stepped in a puddle and fell all the way through it. But today I stepped in one and
absorbed it like a sponge. It rose up inside me til I was sodden, then flushed me into the
pharmacy. I said dumb things to the lady there in the hopes she'd wring me out.<br><br>
There's a hole in my boot or there's something off in my construction. I was blocking bots
on my phone when the doctor called me in. I took off my shirt for him but he didn't seem
inclined.<br><br>
Thin glue, clear and hard, is still clinging to the leather. I wonder what I can wear that won't
crack under my use. My body still surprises me in ways I wish it wouldn't.<br><br>
It's humid in my room and I'm planking on the floor. I look in the mirror and see my face
straining in one corner. My roommate walks in smiling, wearing my blanket like a cape.<br><br>
Swift figures fly around some science fiction Olympus. The leader stands astride it looking
right at where I'm hid. I awoke from that nightmare but somehow I still believe it. There's a
threat seeping into my skin these days that maybe no sleep could solve.<br><br>
“What if superheroes were evil?” is my new million dollar idea. The pharmacist was
professional but I saw behind her mask. And my roommate put up posters to cover the
black mold in the bathroom.<br><br>
But the glue never holds and the air is full of water. When I opened my mouth to say it only
fungus plumed out. I hacked and I coughed, as if that passed for language. I found it hard to
answer when the doctor asked me if I was stressed.
