    Taking down the guitar from a hook on the wall. It's out of tune. I tune it enough to
    play without discomfort. The song is called “Hunting season”. It's about all-out
    conflict and it doesn't have a happy ending. It ends with destruction.<br><br>
    I break a string. Looking for a new one is something I'll do later. I'm in no mood to
    work. I just want to do what I want to do.<br><br>
    A deer passes by outside my window and is soon followed by another. They're
    standing across the lawn and I pick up binoculars to see them better. I can't get the
    focus right and the fish-eye makes me nauseous. I close one eye and that helps a
    little.<br><br>
    Now I see there are more deer than before. Twelve, maybe fifteen. There are more
    deer out there than there are people in this house. They could take it if they wanted
    to. We'd be easily overcome.<br><br>
    I start to wonder if I should be worried. With one eye closed and the other out of
    focus I start to panic. I think I see one looking at me. I think I see them all looking at
    me. Twenty deer, or maybe fifty or a hundred. There's an endless procession of
    deer filing past my house. An unbroken chain stretching back to the primordial
    stag. I see roots and moss hanging from his crown. Tectonic plates draped over his
    antlers like shredded velvet. And I see him struck down by a nascent human blow.
    The stag's legs buckle and his knee hits the ground. A ripple spreads from the
    impact. A domino shudder that echoes up the line. And every deer ever turns their
    head to look at me.<br><br>
    I put down the binoculars and run to the door. There's an air gun leaning there
    loaded with pellets. I still feel blind but I grab it. I open the door and start firing.<br><br>
    They drop when they're hit and it sounds like music. Each one makes a different
    note when struck, like the bars of a xylophone. I'm not scared anymore but I don't
    stop shooting. The deer pile up on the lawn. And the air is full of dissonance.
