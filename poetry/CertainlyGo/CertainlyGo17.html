<div class="nice-words">
    summer after summer i did not think i'd pass through<br>
    but a season is only a season if you pass through it<br>
    <br class="special">
    
    train to job and i'm thinking about you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and god<br>
    cannot tell me when it ends&nbsp;&nbsp; or how<br>
    only that retrospect still hurts my teeth&nbsp;&nbsp; the flashbangs of regret&nbsp;&nbsp; we haven't<br>
    spoken since your birthday&nbsp;&nbsp; but we speak<br>
    in my head&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a thought plays:<br>
    <br class="special">
    
    <i>nothing is mine but the mysteries<br>
    my own patterned violence and burned leads<br>
    this is how i'm trying: this is all i can do<br>
    but prop the window open&nbsp;&nbsp; what lasts in seed&nbsp;&nbsp; a second<br>
    glance of memory<br>
    <br class="special">
    
    i love you.</i><br>
    <br class="special">
    
    make peace while you still can.
