<div class="nice-words">
    no elevator, no<br>
    easier, softer way. you<br>
    panic at the approach of<br>
    your own footfalls' advance, thudding echoes off the snow<br>
    more shadow lakes<br>
    oak branches on the grass<br>
    more laughter<br>
    <br class="special">
    
    his dark neon signage advertising "OPEN"<br>
    and dark, and "OPEN", then dark.<br>

    realize<br>
    sucks to realize, relapse<br>
    <br class="special">
    
    same again<br>
    no oblivion
