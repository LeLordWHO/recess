4th man is a 13yo man named Trent Peet 
<br><br>
&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; Trent Peet's nickname is Trent Feet even though Trent Peet<br>
&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; is already a pretty nickname-ready designation &emsp; cause peat<br>
&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; spurns hot &emsp; and you also want three pointers to hurt well<br>
&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; in a building that would be exceedingly difficult to escape<br>
&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; if some 13yo man accidentally started a peat fire &emsp; in 10<br>
&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; years Trent Peet will come out as homosexual &ensp; day<br>
&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; andmoonlighting as a drag queen &ensp; going by the stage alias<br>
&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; of Trish Teats &emsp; but currently it is 2008 and Trent Peet is the 4th man

of raccoons 3 summers earlier &emsp; it had another name before the<br>

but Roy knows that raccoons are omnivores &emsp; and omnivores<br>

&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; hands &emsp; and then tossing it up above your miniature skull<br>
